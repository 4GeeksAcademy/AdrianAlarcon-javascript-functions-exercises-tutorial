# `05` Anonymous Functions

An `anonymous function` is a function without a name, for example:

```js
function(param1, param2) {
    return param1 * param2;
}
```

See how it is missing a name? Probably you are wondering:

How do I call this function if it doesn't have a name?

**Anonymous functions** need to be stored within a variable in order to be able to use them. For example:

```js
let myFirstVar = function(param1, param2) {
    return param1 * param2;
}
```

Then, I can call my function like this:

```js
let result = myFirstVar(2,3);
```

## üìù Instructions:

1. Print on the console the result of using the function `multi` to calculate the multiplication between `324234` and `47`.
